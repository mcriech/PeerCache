PeerCache
=========

The Ultimate in Cloud Storage!

The downfall of cloud storage is the excessive cost of high capacity servers, 
and high bandwidth requirements for large service communities.

PeerCache utilizes a unique, almost limitless storage space that currently goes 
unused. Traditional cloud storage systems require users to store files on host 
servers, raising legal and liscensing concerns. These host servers require high
startup and maintence costs.

Using P2P technology, PeerCache users man store files securely and anonymously
without storing their files on some corporate host server. Best of all, PeerCache
uses the unallocated memory on client computers to store data. User data is 
sharded and stored accross user base machines without inhibiting any of the hosts.

By using unallocated space, PeerCache has access to near unlimited storage potential
worldwide. The PeerCache client is capable of validating file integrity, ensuring that
adiquate reduncancy is maintained at all times.

TLDR Version:

Unlimited Cloud Storage
Almost $0 maintaince cost
Distributed validation
Anonymous storage
